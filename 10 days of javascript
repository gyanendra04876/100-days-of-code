Day 2: July 19, 2023 



Today's Progress: was working on 3 problems but only solved 2 of them, I will try again tomorrow.

Thoughts: I am in good progress in javascript, sometimes these coding problems get easy and sometimes it becomes so hard that you get frustrated (like mountains).
          whenever I get stuck, I get help from Google or similar videos on youtube.
          (The first two problems were easy though!)

Today's Progress: I was not able to solve the problem till now, I will try again tomorrow.

Thoughts: getting irritated, it has different ways to solve but I want to solve it in my own way.
