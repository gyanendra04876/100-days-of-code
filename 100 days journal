Day 2: July 19, 2023 

Today's Progress: was working on 3 problems but only solved 2 of them, I will try again tomorrow.

Thoughts: I think I am in good progress in javascript, sometimes these coding problems get easy and sometimes it becomes so hard that you get frustrated (like mountains).
          whenever I am getting stuck I am getting help from Google or any similar kind of videos on youtube.
          (The first two problems were easy though!)
